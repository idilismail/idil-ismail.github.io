I am a theoretical and computational chemist at the University of Warwick. I have recently defended my PhD in Modelling of Heterogeneous Systems in the Department of Physics at the University of Warwick. My thesis is titled “Accelerating Chemical Reaction Discovery Using Graph-driven Searches and Machine Learning Strategies”.
