<h3>Abstract</h3>
This article is intended as a guide for new graduate students in the field of computational science. With the increasing influx of students from diverse backgrounds joining the ever-popular field, this short guide aims to help students navigate through the various computational techniques that they are likely to encounter during their studies. These techniques span from Bash scripting and scientific programming to machine learning, among other areas. This paper is divided into ten sections, each introducing a different computational method. To enhance readability, we have adopted a casual and instructive tone, and included code snippets where relevant. Please note that due to the introductory nature of this article, it is not intended to be exhaustive; instead, we direct readers to a list of references to expand their knowledge of the techniques discussed within the paper. It is likely that this article will continue to evolve with time, and as such, we advise readers to seek the latest version. Finally, readers should note this article serves as an extension to our student-led seminar series, with additional resources and videos available at [this URL](https://computationaltoolkit.github.io/) for reference.
